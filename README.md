## Introduction
Predicting graduate admissions helps universities identify eligible candidates. This project utilizes an ANN to predict admission chances based on features like GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP (Statement of Purpose), LOR (Letter of Recommendation), undergraduate CGPA, research experience, and other factors.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about graduate applicants, including the following features:
- **GRE Score**: Graduate Record Examination score (out of 340)
- **TOEFL Score**: Test of English as a Foreign Language score (out of 120)
- **University Rating**: Rating of the university (1 to 5)
- **SOP**: Strength of the Statement of Purpose (1 to 5)
- **LOR**: Strength of the Letter of Recommendation (1 to 5)
- **CGPA**: Undergraduate GPA (out of 10)
- **Research**: Research experience (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

The target variable is the **Chance of Admission** (ranging from 0 to 1).

## Steps to Build the Model

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Load the dataset**: Load the dataset (e.g., in CSV format) using libraries like `pandas` and inspect it for missing or incorrect values.
- **Handle missing data**: Fill in any missing values or remove incomplete rows.
- **Feature scaling**: Normalize the features using a scaler like `MinMaxScaler` from `scikit-learn` to bring all input features into the same range, improving model performance.
- **Train-test split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training and 20% testing) using `train_test_split` from `scikit-learn` to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

### 2. Model Design and Compilation
- **Design the ANN**: 
  - Input layer: Number of neurons equal to the number of input features (e.g., 7 input features).
  - Hidden layers: One or more hidden layers with fully connected (dense) layers, typically using ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions.
  - Output layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to output the probability of admission (0 to 1).
- **Compile the model**:
  - **Loss function**: Use `binary_crossentropy` since the output is a probability.
  - **Optimizer**: Use `adam` for efficient gradient descent.
  - **Metrics**: Track `accuracy` or other relevant metrics to monitor model performance during training.

### 3. Model Training
- **Train the model**: 
  - Train the model using the training data over a defined number of epochs (e.g., 100 epochs).
  - Use a validation split (e.g., 20% of the training data) to monitor overfitting during training.
  - Plot training and validation loss/accuracy to analyze performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Evaluate the model**: After training, evaluate the model on the test data to measure performance on unseen data. Key metrics to look at include accuracy, loss, and any other relevant indicators.
- **Fine-tuning**: If necessary, adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, number of neurons, batch size, etc., based on the model's performance.

## Results
- The model predicts the probability of admission based on the input features.
- Performance metrics and evaluation plots (e.g., loss and accuracy curves) will be provided in the notebook or script for analysis.
- Example output: "The model predicted a 90% chance of admission for a candidate with a GRE score of 320, a TOEFL score of 110, and a CGPA of 9.0."
